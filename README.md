This repo hosts the analytics of UC Irvineâ€™s Machine Learning Repository: Heart Disease Data Set. This directory contains 4 databases concerning heart disease diagnosis. The data was collected from four different locations:

Cleveland Clinic Foundation (cleveland.data) Hungarian Institute of Cardiology, Budapest (hungarian.data) V.A. Medical Center, Long Beach, CA (long-beach-va.data) University Hospital, Zurich, Switzerland (switzerland.data)

For our purposes, we would take the Cleveland Clinic Foundation data. Cleveland Clinic Heart Disease dataset which contains 13 variables related to patient diagnostics and one outcome variable indicating the presence or absence of heart disease. The data was accessed from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The goal is to be able to accurately classify patients whether they have heart disease or not based on diagnostic test data.

Q: Which health biomarkers are considered to be the most important when trying to predict the presence of heart disease?
